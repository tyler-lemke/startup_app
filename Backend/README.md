# Example Blog API

## Description
Simple API utilizing:

 - Express - Fast API creation with flexible middleware
 - Nodemon - Hot reloading for fast feedback loops
 - DotEnv - "Keep it secret, Keep it safe" - protect those credentials for the DB and more
 - Mongoose - ORM that gives structure for MongoDB interaction
 - MongoDB - Underlying Database

The entry point to the application is index.js.

Currently the App is only broken up into models and routes.

Separating out the code even further into controllers and services may be even more ideal if your app is complex enough.
